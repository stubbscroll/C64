solutions for some project euler problems in 6502 assembly language, to be run
on commodore 64.

use the acme assembler, compile with

acme xyz.asm

where xyz is the problem number. this should result in the file xyz.prg which
can be loaded and run in an emulator.

please use these programs as a source for learning arithmetic routines on 6502,
not for blindly boosting your project euler rank. not that using these programs
is practical anyway.
